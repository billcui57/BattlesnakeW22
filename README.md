# A minimax [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) written in Typescript

Utilized the minimax algorithm to forecast and predict future game states. Complimented with alpha beta pruning to greatly reduce search space for optimal game path.

- Second place in RBC's AI Snake competition

# Other algorithms used

- Flood filling to determine how much space the snake head has access to in each possible direction
- A star to path find towards food

- In the screenshot above the minimax algorithm predicts several moves ahead that its tail would have moved out of the way after the snake has traversed the green path, allowing for it to escape.
